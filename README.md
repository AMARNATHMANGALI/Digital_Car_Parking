# Digital Car Parking System

This project is a C-based application that simulates the management of a digital car parking system. 
The program tracks available parking spots, handles vehicle entry by assigning the first available spot, and manages vehicle exits while calculating parking fees based on the duration of stay. 
The system uses a simple text-based interface to guide users through checking availability, registering vehicle entry, and processing exits. 
The program is ideal for demonstrating basic C programming concepts such as arrays, file handling, and simple algorithms. 
To use the system, simply clone the repository, compile the source code, and run the executable.
